# iCub_crawling_old

This is an import from the *old* code for making iCub crawl. This code probably does not work anymore and is not supported.. but we need to keep it somewhere accessible to the iCubers as sourceforge (where the code was hosted before) recently died. 

If you need to make the iCub crawl, please refer to the new version of the crawling modules that we are developing now.
